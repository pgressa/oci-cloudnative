The Micronaut MuShop is a showcase of several [Oracle Cloud Infrastructure](https://cloud.oracle.com/en_US/cloud-infrastructure) services in a unified reference application, written entirely in Micronaut. 

This project is a fork of the [original MuShop implementation](https://github.com/oracle-quickstart/oci-cloudnative) which used different technologies for each individual Microservice applicationÂµ and is designed as a demonstration of how to use Micronaut to build applications for Oracle Cloud.

The sample application implements an e-commerce platform built as a set of microservices. The accompanying content can be used to get started with cloud native application development on Oracle Cloud Infrastructure.

MuShop can be deployed to Oracle Cloud Infrastructure on [Kubernetes](https://kubernetes.io/) with [Helm](https://helm.sh) and [Terraform](https://www.terraform.io), or run locally in [Docker](https://www.docker.com/).

### Docker

To deploy locally with Docker, follow [these instructions](https://github.com/pgressa/oci-cloudnative/blob/master/deploy/complete/docker-compose). 

### Helm
Micronaut MuShop Complete is a Microservices application built to showcase a cloud-native approach to application development on Oracle Cloud Infrastructure with Micronaut & GraalVM using Oracle's [cloud native](https://www.oracle.com/cloud/cloud-native/) services. MuShop Complete uses a Kubernetes cluster, and can be deployed using the provided `helm` charts. It is recommended to use an Oracle Container Engine for Kubernetes cluster, however other Kubernetes distributions will also work.

The [helm chart documentation](https://github.com/pgressa/oraclecloud-cloudnative/tree/master/deploy/complete/helm-chart#setup) walks through the deployment process and various options for customizing the deployment.

If you do not have an Oracle Cloud account yet, you can create a [free trial account](https://signup.oraclecloud.com).

Note that you will have to create and configure needed Oracle Cloud services manually. For complete automated deployment use the next option [Helm + Terraform](helm+terraform). 

### Helm + Terraform
Deploy the complete MuShop with all Oracle Cloud services automatically using the Terraform scripts. The [terraform documentation](https://github.com/pgressa/oraclecloud-cloudnative/tree/master/deploy/complete/terraform) walks through the configuration process and various options for customizing the deployment.
